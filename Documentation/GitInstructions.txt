Github setup for Ubuntu


// 11/10/2012 Josh Galicic
1. Created account and basic repository on Github.com
2. Basing instructions from here, with some changes: https://github.com/GeoRemindMe/GeoRemindMe_Web/wiki/How-to-set-up-your-repository
	2a. ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com"
	2b. go to https://github.com/account/ssh and clic "Add another public key"
	2c. Paste in the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file on your local machine into the public key field on github.
	2d. execute: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
	2e. execute: ssh git@github.com, make sure it returns back successfully with account name (GCRobotics for us)
	2f. execute the following commands:
			sudo aptitude install git-core git-gui git-doc
			git config --global user.name "firstName lastName"
			git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"  // note that if you enter Geneva.robotics@gmail.com, github will resolve your name to GCRobotics for any commit. This can make tracking who made what change difficult.
			git config --global github.user your_username
3. Now create a new directory where ever you want the repo to go (I use ~/GCRepo)
4. cd into that directory
5. Execute: git init
6. Execute: git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPONAME.git	// where username = GCRobotics and reponame = GCRepo
7. Execute: git pull origin master
8. You should now have a local copy of the repository on your machine
9. There are lots of git tutorials on the internet, but for basics: 
		"git add 'filename'" will add a new file to be tracked by git 
		"git commit -a" will create a commit for every file that has been changed
		"git push" will push all your commits made since the last push up to github.
		"git pull origin master" will pull all changes down from github.
